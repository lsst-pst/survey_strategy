## This script will generate but NOT run the commands to create movies for a series of nights from an opsim run.
## The outputs for each night will be stored in nX (including the movie from each individual night).

## usage: mkOpsMovie.sh [opsim name] [night start] [night end]
## after generating the movies for each individual night, join the movies together using joinOpsMovie.sh
